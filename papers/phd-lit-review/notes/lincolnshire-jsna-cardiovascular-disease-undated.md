## Summary

Cardiovascular disease(CVD) comprises of all heart and criculatory diseases, including coronary heart disease (CHD), angina, heart attack, congenital heart disease hypertnetion, stroke, and vascular dementia. Risk factos such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, and a poor diet. Social isolation is also a risk factor for CVD. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide and a leading public health priority in England. It is estimated that yearly healthcare costs in England related to CVD are estimated at £7.4 billion, with an anual cost to the wider economy of £15.8 billion.

2019 Global Burden of Disease study revealed CVD to be the second highest burder of disease in Lincolnshire, and the number of rears of life lost (either in terms of mortality or disablilty) match national figures. The study identified high blood pressure, diet, high cholesteral and high body mass index as the main risk factors for CVD. Premature mortality rated from CVD in Lincolnshire remains higher than the national average but is improving relative to national numbers. 

CVD mortality rates in lincoln, East Lnsey and Boston are particulary high compared to the rest of the county, showing potential correlation with deprrivation indices and patterns of lifestyle behaviours. Those in the most deprived communities are 30% more likely to have high blood pressure. CVD is more common among South Asian, and African Caribbean thnicities, for males, older individuals, and those experiencing severe mental illness. -- severe prolonged mental illness are at risk of dying 15 to 20 years earlier on average, than others.
