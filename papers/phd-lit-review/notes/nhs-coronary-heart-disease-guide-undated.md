## Summary

Corononary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death in the UK and worldwide. CHD is sometimes called ischeamic heart disease or coronary artery disease.
Symptoms of Cornary heart disease (CHD):
Chest Pain (angina)
shortness of breath
pain in your neck, shoulders, jaw or arms
feeling faint
feeling sick (nausea) - although symtoms vary
CHD happens when your hearts blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries - overtime artieris get filled up with fatty deposits in a process known as atherosclerosis - fatty deposits are called atheroma. Artherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alchohol. - High cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes can increase your risk
Current diagnosing: 
electrocardiogram (ECG)
echocardiogram
chest x-ray
coronary angiogram
Treating CHD:
Lifestyle changes
medicines
angioplasty- insert balloons and stents used to treat and narrow heart arteries 
surgery


## Important Information

- Angina: when arrteries become partly blocked it can cause chest pain - can pass in less than 10 minutes relieved by resting or using nitrate tablet or spary
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): is a test that record electrical activity of your heart, including the rate and rhythm
- Medicines used: Blood thinners - low dose aspirin, clopidogrel
- Statins- if you have high choloesterol, cholesterol-lowering medicine. Atorvastatin, simvastatin. Beta blockers - atenolol, bisoprolol - slows down your heart beat to improve blood flow
- Nitrates: widen your blood vessels

## Relevance to PhD Research

Demonstrates AI/deep learning applications in cardiac imaging analysis Provides clinical context for coronary artery disease and cardiovascular health priorities

This paper is relevant to research on data-efficient deep learning for coronary artery segmentation from CT coronary angiography, with focus on foundation models (CT-FM), minimum data requirements, and clinical deployment considerations for acute coronary syndrome prediction.
