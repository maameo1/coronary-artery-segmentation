## Summary

All established high risk plaque features are associated with Major Adverse cardiovascular events, with the strongest  association observed for lesions with napkin-ring sign. 
HRP includes low attenuation plaque, napkin ring sign, spotty calcification, positive remodeling 

## Important Information

- Main Finding
- High-risk plaque features on cardiac CT angiography are strong independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events, supporting their routine reporting in clinical practice.
- Key Information to Know:
- Study Design:
- This systematic review and meta-analysis included 13 studies with 13,977 patients, of whom 552 (3.9%) experienced major adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up periods ranging from 1.3 to 8.2 years.
- Plaque Types and Risk:
- All plaque types predicted risk, with noncalcified plaque showing the strongest association (hazard ratio 1.45), followed by partially calcified plaque (hazard ratio 1.37) and calcified plaque (hazard ratio 1.23).
- High-Risk Plaque Features - Most Important:
- The napkin-ring sign was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 5.06), followed by low-attenuation plaque (hazard ratio 2.95), positive remodeling (hazard ratio 2.58), and spotty calcification (hazard ratio 2.25).
- Multiple Features:
- Patients with 2 or more high-risk plaque features had the highest risk of events, with a hazard ratio of 9.17.
- Clinical Implication:
- The paper demonstrates that CT coronary angiography can identify vulnerable plaques that predict future cardiac events, making it a valuable tool for risk stratification beyond just detecting stenosis.
