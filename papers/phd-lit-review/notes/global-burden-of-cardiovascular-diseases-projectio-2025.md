## Summary

Global cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden is expected to rise in the few decades, driven primarily by an ageing population worldwide. 
• When standardized by age and population, CVD prevalence is expected to remain relatively constant, while mortality is
expected to fall. This suggests that the effects of primary prevention efforts are set to remain roughly constant, while
worldwide treatment outcomes are anticipated to improve.
• High blood pressures, dietary risks, and high cholesterol are the predominant risk factors expected to drive cardiovascular diseases from 2025 to 2050. A high body-mass index is likely to see a rapid rise in certain regions. Effective regionspecific interventions are vital to arrest the CVD trajectory.
 

## Important Information

- The age-standardized prevalence of the global CV burden will remain relatively constant in the coming decades, suggesting that the net effect of summative preventative efforts will likely continue to be unchanged. From 2025 to 2050, the age-standardized CV mortality will fall by 30.5% as medical care following diagnosis continues to improve. However, crude CV mortality is anticipated to rapidly rise by 73.4%, demonstrating that the ageing global populace will be an important driver of the CV burden. IHD and stroke are identified as the main contributors to the CVD epidemic, and this is underpinned by the worsening trends of hypertension. The Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia super-region will suffer the highest CVD mortality rates and will be the only super-region to witness a rise in ASMR
- for 7 out of 11 CVDs. Males are projected to have much poorer CV outcomes compared with females. These projections may aid health policy-makers in designing tailored interventions to reverse this projected global burden of worsening CV mortality and their associated
- risk factors.

## Additional Notes

Main point here is that The Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia super-region will suffer the highest CVD mortality rates and will be the only super-region to witness a rise in ASMR
for 7 out of 11 CVDs. Males are projected to have much poorer CV outcomes compared with females.

## Relevance to PhD Research

Demonstrates AI/deep learning applications in cardiac imaging analysis Provides clinical context for coronary artery disease and cardiovascular health priorities

This paper is relevant to research on data-efficient deep learning for coronary artery segmentation from CT coronary angiography, with focus on foundation models (CT-FM), minimum data requirements, and clinical deployment considerations for acute coronary syndrome prediction.
