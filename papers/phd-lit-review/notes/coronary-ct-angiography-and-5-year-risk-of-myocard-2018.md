## Summary

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is increasingly being used to assess patients with stable chest pain (angina) because it has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary heart disease. Previously found that among patients who had been transferred to a cardiology clinic with stable chect pain CTA clarified the diagnosis and altered subsequent investigations and treatments. subsequent post hoc analyses showed that the use of CTA in addition to standard care resulted in better clnical outcomes than standard care alone. Patients assigned to CTA were more likely than patient assigned to standard care alone to have commence preventative therapies. At 5 years there was no difference between the groups in the frequency of invasive cornary angiography. The rate of the primary long-term end point was lower in the CTA group than in the standard-care group

## Important Information

We found that the use of CTA, with consequent changes in treatment, resulted in a significantly lower rate of death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction than standard care alone. Although the rates of invasive coronary angiography and coronary revascularization were higher in the CTA group than in the standard-care group in the first few months of follow-up, we did not find any differences in the overall use of invasive coronary angiography and coronary revascularization at 5 years. Our findings suggest that the use of CTA resulted in more correct diagnoses of coronary heart disease than standard care alone, which, in turn, led to the use of appropriate therapies, and this change in management resulted in fewer clinical events in the CTA group than in the standard-care group. Following the SCOT-HEART trial's demonstration that CTCA reduces cardiac events by 41%, there is growing recognition that accurate plaque assessment is critical for risk stratification

## Additional Notes

 demonstrated that coronary CT angiography can reduce myocardial infarction and cardiac death by 41% through improved diagnosis and treatment stratification [SCOT-HEART 2018]. 
By improving the accuracy and efficiency of plaque characterization, our AI approach could help clinicians better identify high-risk patients who would benefit most from intensive preventive therapy.

## Relevance to PhD Research
