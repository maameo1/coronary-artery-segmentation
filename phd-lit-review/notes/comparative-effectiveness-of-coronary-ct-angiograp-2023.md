## Summary

This is a systematic review anpd meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and standard of care (SOC) in the evaluation of acute chest pain. The use of CCTA to evaluate individuals with low-to-intermediate risk for acute chest pain was associated with shorter length of emergency department and hospital stay and reduced immediate costs. CCTA is a noninvasive imaging methof with high accurqcy for diagnosing obstructuve coronary artery disease (CAD).
